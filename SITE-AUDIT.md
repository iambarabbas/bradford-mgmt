## Summary

Bradford Management has strong credentials and experience but the website is significantly underperforming. The combination of technical issues (no HTTPS, broken pages), missing local SEO fundamentals (no schema, no location pages), and thin content means the site is likely invisible in local search.

**The good news:** With a rebuilt site focused on local SEO, Bradford Management can compete effectively. The 25+ years of experience and multi-state presence are genuine differentiators that should be prominently featured.

**Priority #1:** Fix technical issues and establish local search presence
**Priority #2:** Add social proof (reviews, testimonials)
**Priority #3:** Create content for each service area
